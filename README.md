# AI Email Auto-Responder **INBOXAI** üìßü§ñ

Welcome to the **AI Email Auto-Responder** project! This is an innovative email management system powered by **multi-agent AI** technology. The system automates email classification and response generation, leveraging **GPT-4o mini** to provide personalized, context-aware email replies. It's designed to be fully **local**, offering enhanced privacy and control over your email data.

## Key Features üöÄ

- **Multi-Agent System**: A collaborative set of **autonomous agents** works in tandem to classify, generate, and send email responses, ensuring a seamless experience.
- **AI-Powered Replies**: Using the **GPT-4o mini model**, the system automatically generates personalized, human-like responses for various email types.
- **Escalation Workflow**: Complex emails are escalated to the appropriate agent for more detailed handling.
- **Data Privacy**: Everything runs **locally**, ensuring that all your email data remains private and secure‚Äîno external cloud services required.
- **Open-Source**: Developed using **open-source technologies**, this project invites community collaboration and innovation.

## How It Works üîß

1. **Fetch Unread Emails**: The system integrates with your email provider and fetches **unread emails** from your inbox.
2. **Email Classification**: Incoming emails are classified into different categories such as **inquiries**, **notifications**, **meeting requests**, and more.
3. **AI Response Generation**: The system uses **GPT-4o mini** to generate context-aware email replies.
4. **Escalation**: Emails that require more complex or personalized responses are escalated to the relevant agents or human reviewers.
5. **Replying to Emails**: AI-generated replies are sent automatically to the original sender.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Python** for back-end development
- **Streamlit** for the front-end UI
- **IMAP** and **SMTP** for email handling
- **GPT-4o mini model** for AI-powered text generation
- **Open-source libraries**: **dotenv**, **smtplib**, **email**, **email.mime**

## Installation üíª
